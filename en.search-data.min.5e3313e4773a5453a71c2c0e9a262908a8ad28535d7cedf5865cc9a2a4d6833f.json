[{"id":0,"href":"/belfryupkeep/docs/010-introduction/","title":"Introduction","section":"Docs","content":"Introduction #  Details of a bell installation are out of sight and out of mind for a surprising number of ringers but will soon be obvious if their upkeep is neglected. At the least, the bells may become progressively more difficult to handle, leading to poor striking, discouraging ringers and frightening away learners. At worst, it could result in expensive damage to the installation.\nThis online document is addressed primarily at Steeple Keepers, who are responsible for carrying out the activities described here. Their role, appointment and experience levels are described here. We also provide a guide to finding your way around the whole document.\nThe Steeple Keeper #  There are many different sorts of bell installations and many different types of Steeple Keeper. We will need to generalise: please use common sense where necessary to refer our words to your own case.  Role #  A Steeple Keeper (there may be alternative names) is someone who has been appointed to maintain a bell installation in a safe and effective working condition. This will involve regular checks and responding to incidents, carrying out maintenance within the level of their experience, and referring problems to specialists (usually Bell Hangers) where necessary.\nAppointment #  With very few exceptions, the bell ringers do not own the bells. There will usually be what we will term an Authorising Body that will have a legal responsibility for the tower and its contents. Within the Church of England this role is filled by the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council (PCC). Requirements in other jurisdictions are covered in Formal Requirements.\nThe Steeple Keeper must be formally appointed by the Authorising Body in a clear, democratic and traceable way. One example would be a decision recorded in the minutes of a PCC meeting. Once appointed, the Steeple Keeper must maintain contact with the Appointed Body. While this applies to all ringers, it is particularly important for the Steeple Keeper because the operation and needs of a bell installation may not be familiar to the average member of an Authorising Body.\nExperience levels #  This document is NOT intended to provide a qualification system for Steeple Keepers. Rather, we adopt the descriptive terms defined below in bold:\n A Novice Steeple Keeper is one learning the task. We hope this document will be helpful, but the main instruction will come from local experts, both in formal courses and one-to-one practical demonstrations, supported by wider reading and other information, often backed by technical and engineering knowledge and experience. A Typical Steeple Keeper will have carried out all the routine tasks relevant to their own tower under supervision and will then be capable of carrying them out without supervision; most importantly, they will be capable of recognising cases where they do need to seek guidance. Most Steeple Keepers will fall into this category. An Experienced Steeple Keeper will have experience of a wide range of installations and their potential problems (although they will never make the mistake of thinking they know it all). They will play a role in the task of aiding others in the transition from Novice to Typical Steeple Keeper.  In some cases, we will identify tasks which must be carried out by a Specialist, often a Bell Hanger. The fittings and materials of a bell installation may not be familiar to a standard engineering contractor and care must be taken in selecting any other than a specialist Bell Hanger.\nIn this document, we are using the term ‘Bell Hanger’, be they an individual or a company, as having experience in bell installations and meeting the regulatory and insurance requirements to carry out this work.

If you are using a small screen you may need to click on the menu bars (three stacked horizontal lines) in the top left or right to access the menus.\nWithin the text, links to sections within the current chapter, to other chapters, and to external web references are shown in blue. Links shown in bold italic refer to entries in the \u0026lsquo;Glossary\u0026rsquo; chapter.\nEach chapter covers a major component part of a bell installation. The following points should be noted:\n These are not intended as a complete historical description of the component. They provide enough background for the reader to recognise which of the many types of installation they may encounter and the problems which may occur. The basic checks which need to be carried out are described. The maintenance which a Typical Steeple Keeper can carry out is described, and activities that must be referred to a Specialist (usually a professional Bell Hanger) are clearly identified.  Some chapters are common to all activities. Please read them: they are important and some have legal implications. These are:\n Formal Requirements covers the need for ringers to recognise the authority responsible for the tower and its fittings, and the need to establish a good working relationship with them. Relevant regulations are described and outline descriptions are given of differences in jurisdictions other than the Church of England. Faculty Jurisdiction Rules covers the legally based rules which apply within Church of England jurisdiction, with specific guidance on those most relevant to ringers. Health \u0026amp; Safety provides guidance on the practical application of Health \u0026amp; Safety principles within the bell chamber.   If You Are Just Starting Out #  It may be that you have just ‘inherited’ a new tower – perhaps one where there has been no checking or maintenance for a number of years. Where do you start? For either a Novice or a Typical Steeple, we strongly recommend that you initiate a full inspection by an expert – ideally a Bell Hanger. This will provide a baseline for drawing up a schedule for your own regular checking and maintenance (see Maintenance Schedule).\nImage Credits #     Figure Details     Title Picture Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire, new ring of 8 bells, cast by Allanconi in Italy, 2020, installed by Matthew Higby.

Ringers must remember that the Rules are set out in law, with possible penalties if they are not followed. Meeting the Rules is the responsibility of the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council, and ringers must use their specialist knowledge to assist the Church authorities in any application. Guidance should be sought from the Diocesan Secretary, The Diocesan Bell Advisor, and the local Guild or Association.  Ringers are probably aware that a Faculty may be required prior to work being done in a Church of England Church. The faculty process exempts churches from listed building consent and conservation area consent that could apply elsewhere. When alterations are proposed, the parish must present the proposals to the archdeacon. For minor alterations, the archdeacon may authorise the work but more major projects will be judged by the Chancellor of the diocese, taking advice from specialists in the Diocesan Advisory Committee. The faculty is the legal authorisation of the work by the Chancellor.\nThe faculty system is a judicial system, so these notes reflect this style. Parishes and ringers intending do any work in their tower or on their bells must consider the full implications of the amended Rules that took effect on 1st April 2020.\nBackground #  The Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2015 were introduced with the intention of simplifying the faculty process and reducing the burden of administration, in particular for churchwardens and others in parishes with responsibility for church buildings. The major innovation of the 2015 Rules was the introduction of Lists A and B for items that could be undertaken without a faculty, subject to some general conditions stipulated in the Schedule.\n Items in List A may be undertaken by a parish without a faculty and without the need for any form of consultation. Items in List B may be undertaken without a faculty provided the archdeacon is consulted and has given written authorisation. With a few years\u0026rsquo; experience of working with the 2015 Rules, the Church Buildings Council\u0026rsquo;s Rules Committee proposed further simplifications and these were agreed at the July 2019 General Synod. The revised 2015 Rules, known as The Faculty Jurisdiction (Amendment) Rules 2019, came into force on 1st April 2020 and replaced the 2015 Rules.  An article by David Knight, Church Care, on faculties and the latest changes appeared in The Ringing World issue 5682 (20 March 2020), page 287 with a short addendum regarding clock bells on page 337, issue 5684 (3 April 2020).  Changes most likely to be of Relevance for Ringers #  The items in both List A and List B have been amended, in some cases to widen their scope, in others to clarify their meaning. In particular, all maintenance of church buildings, as well as repairs that do not affect the fabric or historic material, is brought within matter in List A. More major repairs to church buildings continue to be covered by items in List B. The existing requirement that such repairs must be identified as routine items in the most recent quinquennial inspection report is removed. Instead, it is replaced with conditions that relate to the nature and scope of the proposed repair. A number of items have been moved from List B to List A. In some cases, a distinction is made between listed and unlisted buildings, with a wider range of works to unlisted buildings being included in List A. A significant number of new items have been added to both Lists. In addition to changes in Lists A \u0026amp; B, there are significant changes to the process required for consultation of stakeholders prior to starting faculty proceedings. Note that one of the general conditions when a faculty is still required, even if the work is in List A or B is \u0026lsquo;… the sale or other disposal of an article of architectural, archaeological, artistic or historic interest….’ – this may affect ringers undertaking what would otherwise be deemed to be routine maintenance or \u0026ldquo;having a good clear out and tidy up\u0026rdquo;.\nFull details of the new legislation are available here and explanatory notes can be found on the Church of England web site under “The Faculty Jurisdiction (Amendment) Rules 2019” here.\nFurther modifications to the Rules were approved by Synod in 2022. These affect the like for like replacement of a wrought iron clapper shaft and louvres in a belfry as a sound control measure. Changes will be made to the tables below when the Rules are passed into law.  The Revised List A: #  The following extract is taken from Schedule I, Table 1 of the Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2019. This extract relates to bells; the section on clocks is also included as church clocks are typically housed in the church tower and in many cases use the ringing bells as clock bells. As stated above, items in List A may simply be undertaken (within the specified conditions) by a parish without a faculty and without the need for any form of consultation.

This chapter covers the specific aspects of H\u0026amp;S when carrying out routine checks and basic maintenance in the bell chamber, in any tower.\nNote that there will be an Authorising Body for work carried out in a tower. Within the Church of England this will be the Church Wardens and the Parochial Church Council; different arrangements may apply in other jurisdictions – see Formal Requirements. Members of this body may not be familiar with aspects of working on bell installations and the ringers must explain and agree their methods of working. Note that this does not detract from the ringers’ own responsibility for safe working.  There is a range of legal requirements must be followed and guidance from the UK Health \u0026amp; Safety Executive is available here. While many of these requirements are written as if only for those in employment, most also apply to volunteers. We identify here general rules intended to help identify potential hazards and to reduce risks to those involved. We recognise that an appropriate balance must be achieved between making the activity achievable while reducing the level of risk to that which is as low as reasonably possible.\nTopics Relevant to Work in the Bell Chamber #  Protecting workers in the bell chamber #  Accidental or malicious interference with the bell ropes may present a hazard when work is being carried out in the bell chamber. The extent of risk depends on the accessibility of the ringing room – this is a particular problem for ground-floor rings. Possible solutions are:\n Making sure that someone is present in the ringing room. This may not be possible unless routine checks and maintenance are being carried out on the same day as general tower housekeeping. Your expected time of completion is known by others and that they check that you return on schedule. Warning notices – an example is shown in the Title Figure (but do not rely on this alone). Hoisting the ropes on a spider. For ground-floor or otherwise accessible ringing rooms this may require a locking system for the spider. Hoisting the ropes up into a secure intermediate room, or even into the bell chamber. Consider security of the building while working upstairs – an open church and tower would enable unauthorised access and could pose risks to those working upstairs. A secured building could prevent access by help in an emergency. Could people upstairs be locked in accidentally by a well-meaning person who was unaware? Arrangements will have to be considered for the building in question: other users, access routes, key holders etc.  Working conditions #  Bell chambers present significant hazards when moving around. The following points should be noted:\n Where possible, maintain three points of contact when making a move. Test any footholds before applying weight. Beware of damaged or rotten floorboards. Do not try to carry large and / or heavy items:  Pull bags of tools, etc, up by rope rather than carrying them up ladders. Where possible, have assistants to pass items safely.   Remember that bells, wheels and ropes will move if force is applied. Be aware of heavy weights. For example, be prepared to take a significant weight if you are supporting a clapper which is about to be removed. Some people may wish to bring a radio or listen to music or other media while working in a tower. This is not recommended (whether with headphones or stand-alone equipment) as people should be able to communicate with each other clearly, particularly if an emergency should arise.  Ladders and working at heights #  Very few towers were constructed with the working platforms, ladders and guard rails that would be built into a newly designed and constructed building. Not all tower staircases even have handrails. Anyone working in a tower must therefore consider how they will access and manoeuvre in and around the bell frame and installation. Remember that some timber - whether ladders, flooring, or other planks and boarding - may be rotten or decayed so not strong enough to take the weight of one or more people perhaps also with the additional weight of heavy items such as a clapper.\nHazardous materials #  Where chemicals are used, the container must be checked for health warnings. For example, white spirit has traditionally been used for cleaning oil and grease spills. But white spirit is harmful to skin and the lungs, and is difficult to dispose of safely. Fortunately, safer materials with low volatile organic compounds (VOC) are now available and should be used instead.\nIf any repainting involves removal of old paint, be aware that this may contain lead. Get advice from an expert.\nAfter work is complete, any paints, chemicals and cleaning products, as well as brushes and rags used to apply them, must be removed from the tower. They should be stored if likely to be reused in appropriate clean dry conditions according to the manufacturers’ instructions, with empty containers and rubbish disposed of safely.\nBird or bat droppings can carry infections such as psittacosis from birds. If extensive, a specialist should be employed for cleaning.\nAlthough less likely in a church tower, there may be old asbestos boarding or lagging in towers. As a hint, if plumbing is or has been installed - for example water tanks and pipework - this may well have been lagged with materials that are now recognised as hazardous.\nPersonal protective equipment #  Suitable personal protective equipment should be worn when working in the bell chamber:\n A boiler suit or, more often nowadays, reinforced workwear. Non-slip safety boots, with steel toecaps and good ankle support. Protective gloves suitable for the task undertaken. Face mask and eye protection, especially for when sanding or creating dust, cleaning up dust and debris, or drilling above head height. If work is being carried out at various levels, a hard hat should be worn to protect against falling objects; for working under bells a bump cap may be preferable (although this will not protect against falling objects).  Examples of gloves, hard hat and bump cap, and safety boots are shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Typical personal protective equipment\nFire protection #  Naked flames and other heat sources should never be used in a tower; smoking is forbidden! Also remember that, when cutting or drilling, swarf and the hole being created may become hot. Swarf may even be hot enough to start a fire if it builds up in contact with other flammable substances.\nWorking alone #  In general, you should NOT work alone in a bell chamber. The only possible relaxation is if someone else is in the tower and in contact with you: the most likely case is when you are fitting a new rope and the helper is in the ringing room holding the bottom end at the correct height.\nBell chambers offer many opportunities for slips, trips and falls. If one of those led to injury when working alone, how would you summon help? You might have a mobile phone – but that could be damaged or you might be unconscious. Will there even be a reliable signal and do you know who to call in an emergency? You might have told someone what you were doing – but how long would it take them to realise what had happened?\nMoving bells #  It may be necessary to swing a bell through a small angle – for example, to listen for noise in the bearings. Remember that it is difficult, even impossible, to stop a moving bell. So be very careful where you place head, hands and feet when a bell is moving, even by a small amount. Make sure that co-workers are aware when a bell is to be moved by someone else.\nCan you work on bells when ‘up’? #  In general, you should NOT carry out work in the bell chamber when any bell is ‘up’. Even moving past an ‘up’ bell to reach one that is ‘down’ may pose unacceptable risks.\nThe only likely relaxation is where it is necessary to observe a bell while a second person is ringing it – to check for rope handling problems, for example, or to check if a newly fitted Hastings stay is binding on the quadrant. Based on a risk assessment, the observer MUST position themself out of any danger (including consideration of the possibility of ejection of a broken clapper) and MUST wear ear protection. Most importantly, the observer MUST be able to contact the ringer immediately in case of any problem. Ideally another person should be present in the bell chamber, again well out of the way of danger.\nLighting and electrical equipment #  A good starting point is for the bell chamber to be well lit with professionally installed lighting. But that is not always available and, in any case, additional lighting may be needed: for example, when working under the bells. In the past, this usually required inspection lamps with trailing mains cables. But the availability of bright, portable, battery powered LED lights removes the risks of tripping and electrocution posed by mains lighting. An LED head torch is invaluable, especially when working in cramped conditions. Examples of an LED head torch and portable light are shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: Examples of portable LED lights\nIf there is no natural lighting in the bell chamber, then more than one light source should be always on. It is very easy to break a lamp or for batteries to fail, leaving those in the bell chamber in complete darkness. Remember that it may get dark while you are working in the tower later in the afternoon or evening!\nA general rule is that mains power tools with trailing leads should be avoided in the ringing chamber. If it is essential, a risk assessment must be carried out and great care exercised to make sure that the cables do not get damaged or add yet more trip hazards. Remember that portable battery power tools are available for almost all tasks likely to be carried out by a Typical Steeple Keeper.\nUsed of closed-circuit TV #  Some churches have installed closed-circuit TV systems allowing a choice of views of (a) the interior of the church (checking for progress of a wedding) and (b) the bell chamber (useful for open day visits). The latter can also be useful in maintaining contact between the ringing room and the bell chamber during maintenance work.\nImage Credits #     Figure Details     Title Picture Typical warning notice.

The arrangement of the spokes is both traditional and functional, although there may be some variations. A wheel is made in two parts to allow it to be fitted around the headstock. This has the bonus of making it easier to manoeuvre the parts up to the bell chamber.\nNaming of Parts #  A typical wheel is constructed from eleven different components, some with different historic names. Figure 1 shows a typical wheel, viewed as it would be seen with the bell ‘down’. The names used in this chapter, with some alternatives in brackets, are identified on Figure 1 as follows:\nFigure 1: Parts of a bell wheel\nA.\tTransom (Long Spoke, Transome, Long Wheel Spoke)\nB.\tMain Spokes (High Rail)\nC.\tTop Spokes (High Spoke)\nD.\tMeeting Spokes (Meeting Rail)\nE.\tBottom Spokes (Leg Spoke)\nF.\tEye Piece\nG.\tHalving Bolts\nH.\tShroud (Cheeks, Shrouding, Rave, Siding)\nThe bell rope enters the wheel through a Garter Hole near the Top Spoke on the ground pulley side of the wheel, the exact location depending on the position of the ground pulley. (Ground Pulleys are discussed in Rope Routes.) This is shown in detail on Figure 2 as follows:\nFigure 2: Details around the garter hole\nA.\tShroud (Cheeks, Shrouding, Rave, Siding)\nB.\tSole (Sole Plate)\nC.\tGarter Hole (Fillet Hole, Gart-hole)\nD.\tWheel Bobbins (Half Bobbins)\nE.\tRope\nConstruction #  Traditionally, bell wheels are constructed from three different types of wood. The spokes are made from oak, the sole from ash and the shrouds from elm. Nowadays, however, shrouds are usually made from marine plywood. Shrouds were formally nailed to the sole but there is a tendency for the nails to rust and nowadays small non-ferrous or stainless-steel screws are used. Sections of shrouding are keyed together by a thin piece of wood, termed a ‘Feather’. Historically, iron feathers were used but these are subject to rusting, causing the end of the shrouding to split.\nThe joint between the two parts of the wheel lies between the Transome (A) and the Meeting Spokes (D) with the two parts secured by the Halving Bolts (G) – all shown on Figure 1.\nAs shown on Figure 2, Wheel Bobbins (D) protect the rope from wear as it emerges from the Garter Hole (C). Within the wheel, the rope is tied off around the two Main Spokes (B on Figure 1) – this figure shows how the edges of the spokes may be chamfered to avoid damage to the rope. (The tying off of a rope can just be seen on the bell in the bacground of Figure 3.) Further information is provided in Ropes and Rope Routes.\nFigure 3: Fastenings to a steel headstock (A), and an angle brace (B)\nA wheel is usually attached to a wooden Headstock by long bolts through the main spokes and the headstock; cast iron or fabricated steel headstocks will usually have provision for a bracket to attach the wheel. An example is shown at (A) on Figure 3. That figure also shows at (B) a steel Angle Brace bolted (it may be screwed) diagonally on the inner face of the wheel to further strengthen the wheel. Wheels fitted to wooden headstocks may have Wheel Stays. These are metal rods fitted between wheel and headstock to brace the wheel (arrowed on Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Wheel stays (arrowed)\nChecks Required #  Wheels are not for Climbing On\nWheels are strong in terms of their designed use, but weak if subjected to a sideways force. Never use a wheel as a climbing frame when moving around the bell frame. They are expensive items to replace.\n The complexity of a wheel and the materials used mean that the amount of maintenance able to be carried out by a Typical Steeple Keeper is limited. But the regular checks described below are essential to spot (and possibly rectify) problems, and to identify problems needing assistance from a Bell Hanger before they become critical.\nWheel not running true #  An initial check is to swing the bell (when down) through a small angle. Any obvious sideways movement of the rim of the wheel shows a wheel that is not running true. If this is substantial it could lead to the rope slipping wheel.\nThe cause may be some looseness in the fastenings, or possibly a bent wheel stay. The further checks described here may resolve the problem. If not, this is a job for a Bell Hanger.\nDamage to the wood #  Any evidence of rot or beetle attack must be addressed immediately. While there are contractors who provide this service, the use of a Bell Hanger is to be preferred.\nGeneral advice is that wood should be treated with a preservative about every 10 years. Bearing in mind that the wheels need removal to do this thoroughly, the use of a Bell Hanger is preferable. It may be possible to combine this with a major overhaul.\nLoose fastenings #  All fastenings on a wheel need to be checked regularly for tightness. This is particularly important for those involving wooden components, which may shrink with variations of temperature and humidity. A Typical Steeple Keeper should be competent to carry out these checks and any required tightening.\nRemember that the most reliable way of checking tightness is to first loosen the nut and then re-tighten. This ensures (a) that the nut is not just rusted in position and (b) that the thread has not bottomed out.  Items to be checked are:\n The halving bolts. These are often coach bolts, with the nuts underneath the transom, and easily missed. The fastenings between wheel and headstock, both on the wheel and headstock sides. Fastenings holding any reinforcing bars strengthening the wheels. For a wooden headstock, fastenings attaching wheel stays, if present.  It may be prudent to prepare a check list of all fastenings, to ensure none are missed. Marking checked fastenings with chalk is another possibility.\nWear and damage #  Items to be covered here are:\nShroud #   Check for any damage. It is not unknown for contractors to cause accidental damage to a shroud while carrying out other work in the tower. If shrouds are nailed to the sole, check for rusting or missing nails. Check for splitting at joints between sections of shroud, possibly resulting from rusting of iron feathers.  A skilled woodworker may be able to rectify any problems found but, considering the complexity of a wheel, and the cost of a new one, the Steeple Keeper should consider consulting a Bell Hanger in all but very minor cases of damage.\nSole #  The sole is usually secured to the spokes by countersunk screws. These must be checked for tightness.

This has a low carbon content with slag inclusions which form a fibrous structure as the material is forged (or \u0026lsquo;wrought\u0026rsquo;) into a finished product. This material is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion resistant and easily forge welded. It is an ideal material for producing a clapper. Unfortunately, it is now difficult to source. Faced with the difficulty of obtaining wrought iron, ductile iron, also known as spheroidal graphitic (or \u0026lsquo;SG\u0026rsquo;) cast iron, became the material of use for clappers. This is iron containing a high level of carbon (around 3%). Unlike the more familiar form of cast iron, where the carbon forms inclusions in the shape of flakes, ductile iron includes alloying elements which result in the carbon forming nodular inclusions, giving a tougher material. Being cast, rather than forged, the shape of the casting pattern is important. Some early SG clappers had oversized shafts, balls and flights which could lead to handling and striking problems, as well as possible damage to the bell. It is possible to machine such clappers to a better profile but this must be done by a specialist. Steel clappers have been made but are not widely used. Since 2005, an increasing number of bells are fitted with wooden shafted clappers. If well designed, these may improve the handling of \u0026lsquo;awkward\u0026rsquo; bells and make it easier to raise large bells \u0026lsquo;right\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; see Wooden Shafted Clappers. \u0026lsquo;Composite clappers\u0026rsquo; are also available: these use a man-made material for the shaft.  Clapper suspension \u0026ndash; historical #  This section describes historical clapper designs to allow a Steeple Keeper to recognise them. The maintenance and repair of such clappers is a specialist task outside the scope of this document.  Up until the mid-19th century, clappers were suspended from a U-shaped wrought iron staple, cast into the crown of a bell during its manufacture. Iron corrodes with time and the corroded staple expands in the crown of the bell, generating stresses which will ultimately lead to cracking of the bell. For this reason, cast-in crown staples must be removed if the bell is to be retained for ringing \u0026ndash; see Removal of a cast-in crown staple.\nThe clapper was usually suspended from a cast-in crown staple using a baldrick (or \u0026lsquo;baldric\u0026rsquo;). In the nineteenth century, in the absence (or after the removal) of a cast-in crown staple, a separate \u0026lsquo;centre bolt\u0026rsquo; would be passed up through the crown of the bell and headstock. The traditional suspension would be made from a stirrup at the bottom of this bolt, with a baldrick or using a wooden block arrangement \u0026ndash; for example, the \u0026lsquo;Rudhall wooden top\u0026rsquo; shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Wrought iron clapper with Rudhall wooden top\nModern independent clapper assemblies #  In modern installations, the clapper is suspended from an independent crown staple, with a centre bolt passing up through the crown of the bell and the headstock. The component parts, shown in Figure 2, are:\nFigure 2: Parts of an independent crown staple\n A fixing nut at the top of the headstock. There are several possibilities for this:  The most common is a castellated nut held in place with a split pin, shown in Figure 3. Stainless steel split pins are preferred to avoid corrosion and they may need to be replaced after removal. A plain nut with a split pin above \u0026ndash; the nut may work loose but should not come off completely. A nut plus a locknut, shown at (A) on Figure 2. A nut with a sacrificial plastic insert \u0026ndash; this type must be replaced every time the nut is removed. Proprietary locking nuts with a metallic spring section that clamps to the thread.   A steel washer between the nut and the top of the headstock (not included on Figure 2 but visible on Figure 3). The part of the centre bolt within the headstock is often of square section. Under the crown of the bell is the crown staple washer, made of leather or fibre, (B) on Figure 2. When the centre bolt nut is tightened, this helps to lock the crown staple in position within the bell. This is particularly important where the inside of the crown of the bell is rough \u0026ndash; for example where the bell has been quarter turned. At the bottom of the crown staple is usually a clevis fitting, (C) on Figure 2, comprising a U-shaped yoke with a pivot pin supporting the clapper \u0026ndash; described in the following section.  Figure 3: Castellated crown staple nut and split pin\nPivot pin and clapper bushes #  Some designs of wooden shafted clappers have a ball bearing suspension. This is outside the scope of this document.  The U-shaped clevis has two holes to accommodate a pivot pin. Usually, one hole and one end of the pin are threaded. After insertion, the threaded end of the pin protrudes through the clevis and is secured by a locknut \u0026ndash; shown at (D) on Figure 2. The other end of the pin has a bolt head or machined flats to allow a spanner to hold the pin while the locknut is tightened. If a bolt head is present, care must be taken not to overtighten as this could crack a cast staple or bend a steel one.\nThe top end of the clapper has a hole through which the pivot pin passes, fitted with a replaceable bush. Various types of bushes may be encountered:\n  Traditionally, clapper bushes were made of lignum vitae. This is a dense wood (it sinks in water) containing oils which provide some natural lubrication. It is ideal as a bearing material and has been used for bearings in hydro-electric plants and nuclear submarines. Unfortunately, the source trees are now regarded as \u0026lsquo;Near Threatened\u0026rsquo; making further use of this material unsustainable. If worn lignum vitae bushes are encountered, they must be replaced \u0026ndash; this is outside the scope of this document.\n  Clapper bushes made from lignum vitae require additional lubrication, either by a screw cap lubricator of the \u0026lsquo;Stauffer\u0026rsquo; type or a grease nipple. Although more modern types of metal or plastic bushes may require no lubrication some bell hangers still provide grease nipples or similar, as shown at (E) on Figure 2. On balance, a method of lubrication is preferred although the benefit of retrospective fitting may be small.\n  Modern types of clapper bush are made of:\n Oil impregnated sintered phosphor bronze. Nylon. Experience with a problem of swelling when damp or at elevated temperature means such bushes are now rarely fitted. Existing nylon bushes need not be replaced if performing satisfactorily. If necessary, the swelling problem can be rectified by careful reaming. TUFNOL. This is a proprietary laminated material impregnated with phenolic resin.    Bushes may be backed by a layer of rubber.\n  Clapper centring pins #  Figure 4: Twiddle pin (A), and double crown staple locknut (B)\nWhile not strictly part of the clapper, it is appropriate to mention these here.\nMost modern rings of bells with cast iron or fabricated steel headstocks have clapper centring pins fitted \u0026ndash; usually known as \u0026lsquo;Twiddle Pins\u0026rsquo;. There is clearance where the crown staple passes through the bottom of the headstock and the crown of the bell: twiddle pins allow the crown staple to be positioned in the centre of the bell. There is a twiddle pin on either side of the headstock, one of which can be seen at (A) on Figure 4. Each pin comprises a machine screw which locates against the generally square section of the centre bolt. The crown staple can be positioned by slackening one pin and tightening the other. Locknuts on each pin allow the pins to be locked in place when the process is complete. (Figure 4 also shows (B) another example of double locknuts on the crown staple.)\nThe use of twiddle pins to correct an odd-struck bell is described in Odd-Struck Bells.\nChecking Clappers #  This Section deals with initial and regular checks of clappers. Routine checks and maintenance should be carried out in accordance with a schedule - see Maintenance Schedule - and results of all checks, including issues raised and how they were resolved, should be recorded.\nFor both practical and safety reasons, the checking and any subsequent maintenance must be carried out by at least two people, taking account of Health \u0026amp; Safety Requirements. The checks described here can be carried out by a Typical Steeple Keeper and helpers on the more modern independent crown staple designs; checks on the older types of clapper suspension may require assistance from more experienced personnel.\nThe procedure for checking is as follows:\nFigure 5: Wooden shafted clapper - note bolts securing ball to shaft\nProcedure for checking a clapper\n  Standing in the pit, swing the clapper to check for squealing or grinding noises. It should swing smoothly and noiselessly. If not, this could indicate problems with the clapper bush. If the clapper has provision for lubrication this should be used.\n  Check the clapper is swinging \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash; that is, the axes of rotation of the bell and the clapper are parallel. This can be checked by loosely holding the clapper vertical while a helper swings the bell through a small angle. If the clapper is not true it will move slightly sideways as the bell swings. Correction of this problem is described in Clapper not swinging true.\n  If this is a first check, assess the extent of the clapper impact area on the inside of the bell. If elongated this indicates wear of the clapper bush.\n  If the bell has a wooden clapper, this is a good time to check the tightness of the bolts securing the shaft to the clapper ball (see Figure 5) and the top fitting. For all clapper types, also check the locknut on the pivot pin. These fittings are subject to vibration, especially if the bush is worn, and it is not unknown for the pivot pin to work its way out and lead to ejection of the clapper. The consequences of this are similar to those of a broken clapper.\n  Check the movement of the clapper by attempting to lift the clapper vertically while a helper holds the crown staple nut lightly (if twiddle pins are present, slacken one of them first). On a well-maintained bell, there should be no vertical movement of the crown staple nut. When finished, remember to re-tighten the twiddle pin.\n  There are two main reasons why movement might occur:\n  The nut may have worked loose. This is unlikely with a castellated nut and split pin or a proprietary type of locknut but might occur with other types of nuts. The corrective action is described in Correcting loose crown staple nut.\n  The crown staple washer may be damaged or have become compressed.\n     With the crown staple tight on the crown of the bell, there may still be some small vertical movement arising from play in the clapper bush. This can be investigated further by the sideways movement of the clapper \u0026ndash; sometimes termed \u0026ldquo;clapper roll\u0026rdquo;. This is a sensitive measurement as a small movement in the bush is magnified by the length of the clapper. Clapper roll is measured most easily by standing in front of the bell with the clapper pulled to touch the rim. The total extent (left to right) of sideways movement can then be measured. The amount of roll should be checked and recorded on each occasion to provide a history of bush wear and to give warning of the need for re-bushing. As a guide, clapper roll over 20mm is warning of a need to plan for re-bushing and over 50mm requires immediate attention. A sudden large increase in clapper roll may indicate breakage of the pivot pin.\nIf the bells have not been inspected for a long time, wear of the bush will also be revealed by an elongated impact area on the bell.  It will be necessary to remove the clapper to investigate (a) noise from the swinging clapper, (b) excessive clapper roll, or (c) possible damage to the crown staple washer or pivot pin \u0026ndash; clapper removal is described in Removal and replacement of a clapper.\nMaintenance #  Removal of a cast-in crown staple #  Removal of a cast-in crown staple must be carried out by a professional Bell Hanger, commonly within their workshop. Note that this work will require a faculty.\nClapper not swinging true #  When working under small bells it may be necessary to remove the slider (if present) to provide better access. You MUST check it has been replaced correctly when the work is complete.  Correction of a clapper which is not swinging true is within the capability of a Typical Steeple Keeper.\nProcedure for correcting a clapper not swinging true\n Slacken off one twiddle pin if present. Helper just slackens the crown staple nut. Steeple Keeper loosely holds the clapper vertical and checks for sideways movement as the helper swings the bell through a small angle. The Steeple Keeper twists the clapper to correct the swing and repeats step 3 until satisfied that the clapper is swinging true. Steeple Keeper holds the clapper in the correct position against the edge of the bell while the helper tightens the crown staple nut and, if fitted, the twiddle pin. Repeat step 3 to check that the clapper is still swinging true \u0026ndash; over-enthusiastic re-tightening of the crown staple nut may rotate the crown staple.   Record a note to repeat the check at the next maintenance session. The clapper will need removal for further investigation if the problem recurs.\nCorrecting loose crown staple nut #  As in replacement of the clapper described below.\nRemoval and replacement of a clapper #  Using local effort to remove and replace a clapper is valuable, since it saves a bell hanger the time and expense of travel to do this small part of the work.  Removal and replacement of a clapper is within the capability of a Typical Steeple Keeper, even if rectification of any problems requires specialist services.\nProcedure for removal of a clapper\n Remove the split pin if present. Slightly loosen the crown staple nut, ideally using the correct size spanner, although a large adjustable spanner is a possible alternative. This may require some effort. If twiddle pins are present, slacken one. Alternatively, slacken both by the same number of turns. Using tape or a marker pen, mark the ground pulley side of the clapper and the crown staple. This is to ensure that the clapper is replaced in the original orientation. A helper stands in the pit ready to support the clapper while the Steeple Keeper removes the crown staple nut. The Steeple Keeper must warn the helper just before the nut comes off the thread. The nut and washer are replaced for safe keeping on the crown staple after removal.   With the assembly removed, any problems with a worn bush, failure of a pivot pin or a damaged crown staple washer will usually be obvious. Any problems can be rectified either by a local engineering specialist or a Bell Hanger. If this involves disassembly of the clapper, the contractor must be required to replace it in the original orientation, using the marks made on the clapper and crown staple in item 3 above.\nNote that the traditional leather or fibre washers may compress gradually and be more easily damaged by movement. Harder materials are available and advice on this should be sought from a Bell Hanger.\nReplacement of the clapper follows the reverse procedure, ensuring that:\n The clapper is replaced in the original orientation and is swinging true \u0026ndash; see Clapper not swinging true. The twiddle pin or pins, if present, is/are tightened. This is done with the crown staple nut just tight (\u0026ldquo;nipped up\u0026rdquo; seems to be the technical term). The crown staple nut is tightened. A rule of thumb is to use reasonable force applied to a 10 inch (25cm) spanner. A final check is carried out to ensure the clapper is swinging true.  The precautions described above to replace the clapper in the same orientation should ensure that the clapper will not become odd-struck (assuming it was not originally odd-struck). If the clapper has not been marked or reassembled incorrectly it will be necessary to check the odd-struckness and correct as necessary \u0026ndash; see Odd-Struck Bells.  Finally, details of the work carried out are recorded for future reference.\nOther Information #  Odd-struck bells #  Ideally, the time it takes for a bell to strike after being pulled off at handstroke should be equal to the time at backstroke. Many ringers will have visited towers where they are warned that a certain bell is \u0026ldquo;a bit slow at handstroke\u0026rdquo; or something similar. But this should not be the case for a modern bell with the clapper hanging in the centre of the bell at rest.\nWe are assuming here that all the checks and maintenance described above have been carried out. This should have eliminated problems caused by clappers not running freely, worn bushes, loose crown staples and so on. All of these could result in unpredictable odd-struckness. But, as a responsible Steeple Keeper, you will have already ruled out all of these.  A bell that is noticeably odd-struck and has twiddle pins can be corrected as follows:\nProcedure for correcting odd-struckness\n With the bell down, pull up the rope and secure it to take the weight of the rope off the wheel. The bell should now be at bottom dead centre of its rotation. If possible, check this with a straight edge and a spirit level across the mouth of the bell. (A bell on plain bearings may need nudging for it to settle at bottom dead centre.) Slightly loosen the crown staple nut. Standing facing the bell, touch the end of a tape measure against the striking surface on the clapper ball (taking care not to move the clapper) and read the measurement to the lip of the bell. Repeat this on the opposite side (it helps to have one person on each side). If the readings are different, slacken one twiddle pin and tighten the other. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the two measurements are equal, ideally to within 1mm. Re-tighten the crown staple nut and twiddle pins, and re-instate the bell rope.   If twiddle pins are not present, the recommendation is to place a tapered washer (or a half-washer) under the crown of the bell. Advice on this should be sought from a specialist.\nElectronic devices are available for measuring odd-struckness \u0026ndash; as described in Odd-struckness and swing periods. It may be possible to find someone able to offer this as a service \u0026ndash; perhaps in your local Guild or Association. Such a device can also offer useful data on the swing periods of bells and the comparison between all bells in the ring \u0026ndash; see also in Odd-struckness and swing periods. While outside the scope of this document, this may be worth investigating as a way of dealing with problems in striking for some rings of bells.\nClapper breakage #  Figure 6: SG cast iron clapper broken at the top end\nThe consequences of a broken clapper (Figure 6) can be serious, with the flying clapper causing expensive damage - maybe even breaking another bell. In the event of breakage, the steeple keeper must check all parts of the installation for any consequential damage.\nFailures such as that shown in Figure 6 usually occur in SG clappers and result from a fatigue crack initiated from a pre-existing defect, leading to failure when the crack reaches a critical size. This type of crack is almost impossible to detect before failure without the use of specialised equipment and certainly not with the clapper in place within the bell.\nBroken clappers, either SG or wrought iron, cannot be repaired by electric welding. This would require specialist welding techniques and is used only for cosmetic welds, not those subject to high stresses. For an SG clapper, the answer is a new clapper. Wrought iron clappers can be repaired by forge welding \u0026ndash; in fact, many wrought iron clappers are made in two parts which are then forge welded to the correct length. But this work must be carried out by a specialist.\nAnother possible cause of clapper failure is the pivot pin working loose and eventually falling out. This is something which should be detectable at an early stage and rectified during regular checks.  In summary, any repairs or replacements for clappers must be carried out by a Bell Hanger. A Typical Steeple Keeper can play a part by removing the remains of the clapper and by installing the new or repaired one.\nWorn clapper ball #  Wear on the striking face of the clapper ball should be checked during routine maintenance. If a substantial flat surface has developed this is a job for a Bell Hanger, although the Steeple Keeper can assist by removing and replacing the clapper. The Bell Hanger may be able to twist and re-forge the shaft of a wrought iron clapper to present a new striking face.\nBell going up wrong #  Some bells, particularly those over 20 to 25 cwt, are prone to going up \u0026lsquo;wrong\u0026rsquo;. That is, the clapper is on the higher (wrong) side of the bell when it is set at handstroke after raising. For some bells, it may be difficult to set the bell when this occurs. This depends on the design of bell and clapper \u0026ndash; more specifically, on (a) the distance between the two axes of rotation of bell and clapper, and (b) the low amplitude swing periods of the bell and clapper. As a rough guide, the low amplitude swing period of the clapper should be at least 90% that of the bell.\nRectification is a job for specialists. Replacement with a wooden shafted clapper may help.\nFurther Reading #  Wooden shafted clappers #  Bernard Taylor provides a history of the development of wooden shafted clappers in: \u0026ldquo;Wheeler\u0026rsquo;s Wooden Wallopers\u0026rdquo;.

You may encounter the two types of bearing – plain bearings and ball bearings. We will describe both, but a Typical Steeple Keeper’s main task will be the important role of carrying out the checks described here. This will help identify any problems before they reach a critical stage.\nA Typical Steeple Keeper can only carry out basic maintenance on bearings: for example, lubrication of plain bearings. Major jobs will usually require the lifting of a bell, even by a small amount, and this is a job for Bell Hangers, who carry the necessary insurances and requirements of Health \u0026amp; Safety regulations. Also, within the jurisdiction of the Church of England, there will be a legal requirement to obtain a faculty for such work. Further details are given in Formal Requirements, Faculty Jurisdiction Rules and Health \u0026amp; Safety.  Ball Bearings #  Description #  Ball bearings started to be fitted to bells only in the early 1920s but their use since then is almost universal, so these are the ones you are most likely to experience.\nFigure 1: Ball bearing - the split for assembly is arrowed\nA ball bearing (Figure 1) is a sealed unit that should require no regular maintenance. The bearing consists of one (or possibly two) rings of hardened steel balls running between two hardened steel tracks. The inner ring is mounted on the gudgeon and the outer on the bearing housing, mounted on the frame. On assembly, the bearings are filled with grease which is retained by seals. The grease provides some lubrication to prevent fretting between the balls and the track, but its main use is to protect the components from rusting.\nDesigns vary, but the type of bearing shown in Figure 1 is split for assembly along the line arrowed. Do not try to separate the two halves during routine checks.\nThe ball bearings used for bell hanging are self-aligning, allowing for small movements of the bell frame – particularly important for wooden frames. Lateral movement, resulting from small movements between the two side frames, is accommodated by a small amount of lateral travel (often termed ‘end float’) on one bearing, usually the one on the wheel side.\nIn many engineering applications, ball bearings provide prolonged satisfactory operation. But the alternating direction of rotation of the bell when ringing is not ideal, and neither are impacts on the bell from clock or chiming hammers. Impacts from chiming hammers is particularly harmful, as the film of grease may not be replenished when the bell is stationary, leading to metal-to-metal contact between the balls and the track.\nRegular checks and maintenance #  Unless you suspect a problem with ball bearings (see Problems with Bearings), the only checks you should undertake are:\n Check the tightness of the bolts holding the bearing to the frame. Check for leakage of grease from the end seals. Check clearances at either side – a bell can ‘travel’ sideways slightly, especially when subjected to a heavy clock hammer. This is unusual but should be checked.   These checks can be undertaken by a Typical Steeple Keeper; but points 2 and 3 can only be rectified by a Bell Hanger.\nSome older ball bearings may have a grease nipple. This does NOT mean they require the grease to be ‘topped up’ regularly – that is a certain way of damaging the seals. Do not use a grease gun on these. The results of over greasing can be seen in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: The unfortunate effect of forcing grease into a ball bearing\nAs noted above, ball bearings are not working in an ideal regime. Even if no problems are experienced, it may be prudent to seek advice from a Bell Hanger on ball bearings more than 10 to 15 years old, especially if the bells are heavily used.\nPlain Bearings #  Description #  A plain bearing (“journal bearing” in engineering parlance) comprises a shaft rotating within a journal. The shaft and journal are made of different materials and the bearing requires lubrication – wear is avoided by the shaft floating on a thin film of oil as it rotates. For a bell, the ‘shaft’ is the steel gudgeon attached to the headstock (the moving part) and the ‘journal’ is a ‘bearing brass’ (sometimes made of bronze) attached to the bell frame (the fixed part). A typical bearing brass, of a type used since the Middle Ages, is shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Parts of a typical plain bearing brass\nThe bearing brass (A) is wedge shaped. Traditionally it was fitted directly into an oak frame; more recently it would be fitted into a metal bedplate attached to the frame. The gudgeon revolves in the groove (B), with a reservoir for the oil (C). The top edges of the groove (D) may be chamfered to conduct surplus oil back to the reservoir. There is a slot (E) for inserting a chisel to remove the bearing. This is a task for a bell hanger, not a Steeple Keeper.\nFigure 4: Parts of a plain bearing assembly\nFigure 4 shows bearings on two bedplates which would be attached to the frame by hold down bolts through the holes at (A). The bearing brass (B) is inserted into the bedplate and the slot for the oil reservoir can be seen at (C). In this design, a felt pad would be placed on top of the gudgeon before the lid (D) is closed. This helps to help distribute the oil around the gudgeon. Note that failure to close the lid leads to loss of lubricant and can cause a bearing to seize.\nFigure 5: Alternative plain bearing assembly with oil reservoir\nFigure 5 shows an alternative design. Again, the holes for hold down bolts and the bearing brass can be seen at A and B, respectively. In this design, the oil is supplied from above in the reservoir (C), which contains a felt wick. The oil can be topped up through the small hole in the top of the reservoir.\nIn most engineering applications, journal bearings will operate with a steady rotation maintaining the oil film. In full circle ringing, however, the bell comes to rest with mouth upwards then turns in the opposite direction. At this point the oil film compresses and this has a very marginal braking effect on the bell. Some ringers feel that this helps to control the bell near the balance. This may be a myth: you need to make up your own mind.\nMost plain bearings allow a small amount of end float, but they are not self-aligning. This means that the gudgeons must be accurately aligned on installation. This presents a problem for wooden frames which may distort with time. This can lead to ‘pinching’ resulting in sudden dropping of the bell. This should not be a problem for plain bearings correctly mounted on metal frames.\nRegular checks and maintenance #  This describes the work which should be carried out regularly by a Typical Steeple Keeper. Dealing with more fundamental problems is described below in Problems with Bearings.  The main routine task for plain bearings is lubrication. Traditionally, castor oil was used – more specifically the ‘veterinary grade’. This may be difficult to procure, and an alternative is the oil developed to lubricate the chain on chainsaws. This contains a component to enhance the ‘anti-fling’ property needed for chainsaws and this may help to maintain the lubrication of the bearing. During lubrication, it is important to keep the area around the bearing clean to avoid ingress of any abrasive particles, such as dust and grit from tower masonry.\nDo not use grease as a lubricant. It forms an arch over the revolving part and never reaches where it is needed.\nThe recommendation is to lubricate little and often, preferably before each ringing session. A Steeple Keeper may find this unduly onerous: this is probably the major objection to the use of plain bearings.\nDuring a routine inspection, the Steeple Keeper should carry out two other checks:\n With the bearing cap open, check for any scoring on the gudgeon. This may indicate abrasive particles in the bearing. If it becomes severe it may be necessary to clean the bearing. This requires lifting the bell which, as noted earlier, is a job for a Bell Hanger. For a wooden frame, check that frame movement or damage has not caused the bearing to move. Again, if this is the case, it is a job for a Bell Hanger.   Problems with Bearings #  DANGER: Extreme care must be exercised when carrying out the tests described in this section and two people (at least) must be present. Even when swinging through a small angle a bell can cause considerable damage if clothing or body parts become trapped.  Even if no obvious problems have been detected, the ‘go’ of one or more bells may have become worse, on either plain or ball bearings. Ultimately, this is a problem for a Bell Hanger, but a Typical Steeple Keeper can get some information by listening carefully as the bell is swung by a SMALL amount while DOWN. Any squeaking, grinding or rumbling may indicate a problem and will signal the need for an expert opinion.\nFor this to work, other extraneous noise must be minimised:\n The clapper should be tied to remove any noise from the clapper bush. The rope should be tied clear to remove noise from pulleys, loose bosses and rope chutes, and the bell swung by hand.  A further test would be to swing several bells by the same small amount and check the times taken for the bell to come to rest. A time much shorter than for bells of similar weight could indicate a bearing problem.\nA Final Warning #  To reiterate what we have said above: a Steeple Keeper must NOT attempt to dismantle bearings, plain or ball, and must not undertake any work which involves lifting a bell, even by levering it up a small amount.\nImage Credits #     Figure Details     1 Ball bearing on the Tenor bell at Gloucester Cathedral.

Some other technical terms may not be familiar to ringers. We hope to have included all of these here. They are linked from the text in the various chapters.\nArgent #  The central boss on the crown of older bells, around which the canons are grouped. These are used to attach the bell to the headstock.\nBaldrick #  A U-shaped metal strap with leather lining from which clappers used to be suspended. The name originates from a belt worn over one shoulder to support a sword or bugle and is sometimes referred to as a \u0026lsquo;baldric\u0026rsquo;.\nCanons #  (Sometimes \u0026lsquo;Cannons\u0026rsquo;). The loops cast onto the crown of older bells, by which the bells is suspended from the headstock.\nClapper #  The component suspended inside a bell which, when the bell is swung, strikes the bell to produce the note. See Clappers.\nCoach Bolts #  Coach bolts (sometimes referred to as \u0026lsquo;Carriage Bolts\u0026rsquo;) are used in a bell installation for bolting a wooden component to either a metal or wooden component - most often to bolt a stay onto a headstock. The square section under the domed head bites into the wood, securing the head while the nut is tightened.\nFretting #  Fretting refers to wear damage of loaded surfaces in contact with little or no lubrication, encountering movement tangential to the surface. Fretting is caused by adhesion of surface asperities, which are then broken by the small movement.\nGrease Nipple #  Designs vary, but this is a device for lubricating a component with moving parts. A grease gun locks on to the nipple and grease can be pumped in. The picture above is of a grease nipple (arrowed) on a clapper clevis, which allows lubrication of the clapper bush \u0026ndash; see Clappers. Grease nipples may be found on ball bearing housings: these are used to charge the bearing with grease on manufacture and should not be pumped with grease during use. This is a sure way of damaging the seals on the bearing \u0026ndash; see Bearings.\nGudgeons #  The steel shafts fixed to the headstock that form the axle about which the bell rotates.\nHeadstock #  A wood or metal beam supporting the bell. The wheel, stay and gudgeons are attached to the headstock.\nPsittacosis #  Psittacosis is an infection of birds caused by the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci. Birds can transmit C. psittaci to humans; the resulting infection is also known as psittacosis or ornithosis.\nWheel #  A circular wooden component attached to the headstock by which the rope is attached to the bell, permitting it to be rung full circle. See Wheels.\nImage Credits #     Glossary Item Details     Coach Bolts Photo: Robin Shipp   Grease Nipple Enlarged from photo by Allen Nunley     Version 0.1 (pre-publication), March 2022\n© 2022 Central Council of Church Bell Ringers\n"}]
