At the least, the bells may become progressively more difficult to handle, leading to poor striking, discouraging ringers and frightening away learners. At worst, it could result in expensive damage to the installation.
This online document is addressed primarily at Steeple Keepers, who are responsible for carrying out the activities described here.</description></item><item><title>Formal Requirements</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/020-permissions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/020-permissions/</guid><description>Formal Requirements # This is a stub
This section will cover permissions to work in general, Such as:
The role of the PCC (within CofE), incorporating the Who Owns the Bells? section in MBM Introduction chapter Listed buildings, and Ecclesiactical Exemption Archaeologically significant sites Other relevant things? There will also be sections covering towers in jurisdictions outside England, including towers owned privately and by municipialities. This will extend the role of the &amp;lsquo;owner&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Faculty Jurisdiction Rules</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/030-faculty-rules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/030-faculty-rules/</guid><description>Faculty Jurisdiction Rules # This chapter refers to activities carried out in churches within the jurisdiction of the Church of England. Ringers must remember that the Rules are set out in law, with possible penalties if they are not followed. Meeting the Rules is the responsibility of the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council, and ringers must use their specialist knowledge to assist the Church authorities in any application. Guidance should be sought from the Diocesan Secretary, The Diocesan Bell Advisor, and the local Guild or Association.</description></item><item><title>Health &amp; Safety</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/040-health-and-safety/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/040-health-and-safety/</guid><description>Health &amp;amp; Safety # Consideration of Health &amp;amp; Safety (H&amp;amp;S) is important for all activities within a tower. This chapter covers the specific aspects of H&amp;amp;S when carrying out routine checks and basic maintenance in the bell chamber, in any tower.
Note that there will be an Authorising Body for work carried out in a tower. Within the Church of England this will be the Church Wardens and the Parochial Church Council; different arrangements may apply in other jurisdictions – see Formal Requirements.</description></item><item><title>Bell Frames</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/050-bell-frames/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/050-bell-frames/</guid><description>Bell Frames # Under construction</description></item><item><title>Headstocks</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/060-headstocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/060-headstocks/</guid><description>Headstocks # Under Construction</description></item><item><title>Wheels</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/070-wheels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/070-wheels/</guid><description>Wheels # The basic design of bell wheels has changed little over the past 200 years. The arrangement of the spokes is both traditional and functional, although there may be some variations. A wheel is made in two parts to allow it to be fitted around the headstock. This has the bonus of making it easier to manoeuvre the parts up to the bell chamber.
Naming of Parts # A typical wheel is constructed from eleven different components, some with different historic names.</description></item><item><title>Stays &amp; Sliders</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/080-stays-and-sliders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/080-stays-and-sliders/</guid><description>Stays &amp;amp; Sliders # Under construction</description></item><item><title>Clappers</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/090-clappers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/090-clappers/</guid><description>Clappers # This chapter covers:
Background: The various types of clappers, how they are made and suspended within the bell Routine Checking: The ways in which clappers can be checked, both as part of a routine maintenance schedule and to investigate any problems Maintenance: The options for dealing with problems and the level of experience needed to carry them out Final sections cover: Other Information relevant to clappers and Further Reading Background # A clapper assembly comprises four main components:</description></item><item><title>Bearings</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/100-bearings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/100-bearings/</guid><description>Bearings # The main bearings are critical items: in any installation, they support the large mass of metal swinging through a full circle and their condition is fundamental to the ‘go’ of the bell. You may encounter the two types of bearing – plain bearings and ball bearings. We will describe both, but a Typical Steeple Keeper’s main task will be the important role of carrying out the checks described here.</description></item><item><title>Rope Routes</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/110-rope-route/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/110-rope-route/</guid><description>Rope Routes # Under construction</description></item><item><title>Ropes</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/120-ropes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/120-ropes/</guid><description>Ropes # Under construction</description></item><item><title>Bells</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/130-bells/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/130-bells/</guid><description>Bells # Under construction</description></item><item><title>Chiming Hammers</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/140-chiming-hammers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/140-chiming-hammers/</guid><description>Chiming Hammers # Under construction</description></item><item><title>Maintenance Schedule</title><link>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/150-maintenance-schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mtelvers.github.io/belfryupkeep/docs/150-maintenance-schedule/</guid><description>Maintenance Schedule # An online version of this will be introduced in due course.

Some other technical terms may not be familiar to ringers. We hope to have included all of these here. They are linked from the text in the various chapters.
Argent # The central boss on the crown of older bells, around which the canons are grouped.</description></item></channel></rss>
