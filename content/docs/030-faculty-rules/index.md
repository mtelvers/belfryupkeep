# Faculty Jurisdiction Rules

{{<hint danger>}}
This chapter refers to activities carried out in churches within the jurisdiction of the Church of England. Ringers must remember that the Rules are set out in law, with possible penalties if they are not followed. Meeting the Rules is the responsibility of the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council, and ringers must use their specialist knowledge to assist the Church authorities in any application. Guidance should be sought from the Diocesan Secretary, The Diocesan Bell Advisor, and the local Guild or Association.

Ringers are probably aware that a Faculty may be required prior to work being done in a Church of England Church. The faculty process exempts churches from listed building consent and conservation area consent that could apply elsewhere. When alterations are proposed, the parish must present the proposals to the archdeacon. For minor alterations, the archdeacon may authorise the work but more major projects will be judged by the Chancellor of the diocese, taking advice from specialists in the Diocesan Advisory Committee. The faculty is the legal authorisation of the work by the Chancellor.  

The faculty system is a judicial system, so these notes reflect this style. Parishes and ringers intending do any work in their tower or on their bells must consider the full implications of the amended Rules that took effect on 1st April 2020.

## Background 

The Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2015 were introduced with the intention of simplifying the faculty process and reducing the burden of administration, in particular for churchwardens and others in parishes with responsibility for church buildings. The major innovation of the 2015 Rules was the introduction of Lists A and B for items that could be undertaken without a faculty, subject to some general conditions stipulated in the Schedule. 
-	Items in List A may be undertaken by a parish without a faculty and without the need for any form of consultation. 
-	Items in List B may be undertaken without a faculty provided the archdeacon is consulted and has given written authorisation.
With a few years' experience of working with the 2015 Rules, the Church Buildings Council's Rules Committee proposed further simplifications and these were agreed at the July 2019 General Synod. The revised 2015 Rules, known as The Faculty Jurisdiction (Amendment) Rules 2019, came into force on 1st April 2020 and replaced the 2015 Rules.

An article by David Knight, Church Care, on faculties and the latest changes appeared in The Ringing World issue 5682 (20 March 2020), page 287 with a short addendum regarding clock bells on page 337, issue 5684 (3 April 2020).

## Changes most likely to be of Relevance for Ringers
The items in both List A and List B have been amended, in some cases to widen their scope, in others to clarify their meaning. In particular, all maintenance of church buildings, as well as repairs that do not affect the fabric or historic material, is brought within matter in List A. More major repairs to church buildings continue to be covered by items in List B. The existing requirement that such repairs must be identified as routine items in the most recent quinquennial inspection report is removed. Instead, it is replaced with conditions that relate to the nature and scope of the proposed repair.
A number of items have been moved from List B to List A. In some cases, a distinction is made between listed and unlisted buildings, with a wider range of works to unlisted buildings being included in List A. A significant number of new items have been added to both Lists. 
In addition to changes in Lists A & B, there are significant changes to the process required for consultation of stakeholders prior to starting faculty proceedings. 
Note that one of the general conditions when a faculty is still required, even if the work is in List A or B is '… *the sale or other disposal of an article of architectural, archaeological, artistic or historic interest*….’ – this may affect ringers undertaking what would otherwise be deemed to be routine maintenance or "*having a good clear out and tidy up*".

Full details of the new legislation are available [here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1184/made) and explanatory notes can be found on the Church of England web site under “The Faculty Jurisdiction (Amendment) Rules 2019” [here](https://www.churchofengland.org/sites/default/files/2019-06/GS%202137X%20FJ%28A%29R%20Exp%20Notes.pdf).

Further modifications to the Rules were approved by Synod in 2022. These affect the like for like replacement of a wrought iron clapper shaft and louvres in a belfry as a sound control measure. Changes will be made to the tables below when the Rules are passed into law.

## The Revised List A:
The following extract is taken from Schedule I, Table 1 of the Faculty Jurisdiction Rules 2019. This extract relates to bells; the section on clocks is also included as church clocks are typically housed in the church tower and in many cases use the ringing bells as clock bells. As stated above, items in List A may simply be undertaken (within the specified conditions) by a parish without a faculty and without the need for any form of consultation. ***Bold Italic text*** indicates changes in the text between the 2015 and the 2019 versions.

-	Repair clock bell hammers – now added to list A
-	Take down and reposition 2 old peal boards fixed on ringing room wall (not normally visible to public) and add a new peal board in the space created after rearrangement – remains in List B
